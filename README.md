# W4D3-WebDevA-JS

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

* This is a GitHub repo made for the Week 4 Day 3 of Web Dev A - Innovation Fellowship class, where we are still continuing our journey with JavaScript.
    * Continued learning conditionals, ternary, and other operators.
    * Briefly mentioned functions.
    * Messed with scope and it's importance when working with global and block scope variables.

* This repository also houses the boxing assignment. This is a boxing game that cycles between two players, dealing damage to each other until one player is knocked out OR their health reaches 0, thus rendering them knocked out and declaring the other player the winner.
    * This game uses Javascript functions and conditionals to execute a looped game experience that varies based on certain conditions being met.
    * Different gameplay scenarios vary based on the types of hits landed.
        * Basic Hits - Less than 6 damage.
        * Critical Hits - Greater than or equal to 6 damage and less than or equal to 9 damage.
        * Knockouts - Greater than or equal to 10 damage.
    * This game can be re-run using a the "node boxing.js" prompt on the CLI.
